## Overview

### The challenge
Code Caf√© - Our objective was to create a Landing Page for a gourmet coffee shop, based on the design and materials that we were given.

- Having a responsive layout, so that my end user doesn't have problems, regardless of the screen size they are using to access.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Code Coffee Page" src="./src/read/code-coffee.gif" width="70%">
  <img alt="Code Coffee Mobile Page" src="./src/read/code-coffee-mobile-screen.gif" width="17%">
</p>

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
One of the goals of this project was to build it without the CSS Grid and Flexbox properties, so it was a project where we used a lot of display and position to leave the elements in their place. But one of the things I learned most about this project was the practical use of the media quare to make the site fully responsive.



### Continued development
My focus on the next projects will still be on the front-end, very enthusiastic about the studies I hope to create increasingly complex projects using programming languages and frameworks.
