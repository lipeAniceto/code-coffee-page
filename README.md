## 📃 Overview

### The challenge
Code Café - Our objective was to create a Landing Page for a gourmet coffee shop, based on the design and materials that we were given.

- Having a responsive layout, so that my end user doesn't have problems, regardless of the screen size they are using to access.

## 🎯 My process

### Built with
<br>

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
#

### What I learned
<br>
One of the goals of this project was to build it without the CSS Grid and Flexbox properties, so it was a project where we used a lot of display and position to leave the elements in their place. But one of the things I learned most about this project was the practical use of the media quare to make the site fully responsive.

#

### Continued development
<br>

My focus on the next projects will still be on the front-end, very enthusiastic about the studies I hope to create increasingly complex projects using programming languages and frameworks.
